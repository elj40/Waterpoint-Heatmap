# Waterpoint-Heatmap
- My first project using GLSL shaders and shaders in general
- Used to visulaize the pressure that animals exert on the vegetation surrounding vegetation due to artifically made water sources

**To Do**
- Make graphs reactive to the average pressure exerted on an area 9kind of acheived in v2)
