# Waterpoint-Heatmap
- My first project using GLSL shaders and shaders in general
- Used to visulaize the pressure that animals exert on the vegetation surrounding vegetation due to artifically made water sources

**To Do**
- Implement a version that relies on CSS and Vanilla JS instead of p5 and shaders
- Make graphs reactive to the average pressure exerted on an area
